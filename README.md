# OpenCV Learning Project - Murtaza's Workshop

This repository contains all my project files, code, and notes as I learn Computer Vision with Python and OpenCV from the "Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI" YouTube channel.

## About This Project

The main goal of this repository is to practice and implement the concepts taught in the **OpenCV Python Tutorials for Beginners 2020** playlist. Each folder or file will correspond to a specific lesson or project from the tutorial series.

This is a personal learning project to track my progress and build a portfolio of my computer vision skills.

## Setup and Requirements

To run these projects, you will need to have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x**
* **OpenCV:** Can be installed via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```
* **NumPy:** Will usually be installed as a dependency with OpenCV, but just in case:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

## Acknowledgments

A huge thank you to **Murtaza's Workshop** for creating such high-quality, free educational content on robotics and AI.
